\section{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

Launching a new rental aggregator in a competitive market like Rio de Janeiro presents unique challenges. Chief among them is the cold start problem: without historical user data—such as bookings, reviews, or behavioral patterns—it becomes nearly impossible to rank listings meaningfully or offer relevant recommendations. This lack of personalization leads to poor user experience and ultimately hampers platform growth.

To address this, we propose a data-driven solution that leverages publicly available Airbnb data for the Rio de Janeiro region. By training a predictive model on this dataset, we aim to estimate review scores for our own listings based purely on their features—such as location, price, amenities, and host attributes. These predicted scores can then be used to inform ranking decisions on our platform, improving discoverability for quality listings and boosting user engagement.

This project aligns technical goals with core business objectives: mitigate the cold start issue, enhance booking conversion rates, and accelerate revenue generation. The following sections outline the detailed business context, data landscape, and our approach to building a reliable predictive system under real-world constraints.

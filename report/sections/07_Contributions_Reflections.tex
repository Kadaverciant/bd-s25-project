\subsection{Report summary }
Write a summary of your report.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe how you decided to scope (and/or re-scope) your problem formulation during the work, and given the data you had access to.
  \item Describe how you searched for knowledge on how to scope the business problem you wanted to address.
  \item understand how to implement, test, and validate your results.
  \item Which sources helped you to get progress and how?
  \item What would you have done differently if you were to start over again, for understanding the problem faster and for understanding what could be done with the data you had access to?
  \item What else is there that you would have changed about this project?
\end{itemize}
